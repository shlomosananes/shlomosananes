## Hello data people, I am Shlomo, a brazilian living in Tel Aviv and passionate about data ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± I just completed a Data Analytics Bootcamp and can't wait to start applying my new skills on the field.

âš¡ Fun fact: I had to change my name from SalomÃ£o to Shlomo when I moved to Israel so nobody would have a hard time trying to pronounce my name.
