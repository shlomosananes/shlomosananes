## Hello data people, I am Shlomo, a brazilian living in Tel Aviv nd passionate about data ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**shlomosananes/shlomosananes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ğŸŒ± I just completed a Data Analytics and can't wait to start applying my new skills on the field.
âš¡ Fun fact: I had to change my name from SalomÃ£o to Shlomo when I moved to Israel so anybody would have a tough moment pronouncing my name.
